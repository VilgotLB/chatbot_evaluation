What factors contributed to the decline and fall of the Pax Mongolica?,"But some of the things that made the Pax Mongolica so efficient are what caused its decline and fall in the mid-1300s.

The plague originated in central Asia, making its way westward to Europe where it spread further. In addition to disease, the fragmented empire endured increasing turmoil from within. This prevented further expansion and hastened its inevitable decline.","The decline and fall of the Pax Mongolica was contributed by several factors. The Black Death pandemic, which swept through the empire in the 14th century, significantly reduced the population and disrupted trade. The empire's vast territory and diverse populations led to fragmentation and regionalism, as local leaders and khanates began to assert their independence. Additionally, the rise of rival powers, such as the Ming dynasty in China and the Grand Duchy of Moscow in Russia, challenged Mongol dominance.
